#  Fleet Management System (Java Console App)

This is a simple Java-based console application that simulates a basic Fleet Management System. It allows you to manage a list of trucks â€” including adding, removing, and updating details like driver name and status â€” through a user-friendly menu.

---

##  Features

- Add new trucks with details like truck ID, driver name, mileage, fuel level, and status  
- View all trucks currently in the fleet  
- Remove a truck by its unique truck ID  
- Update a truck's status (e.g. Available, In Transit, In Maintenance)  
- Update the driver assigned to a truck

## About the Author

This project was created as part of my Java learning journey to better understand how object-oriented concepts can be applied to real-world systems â€” like managing a fleet of vehicles for a logistics company. Itâ€™s simple, but meaningful, and helped me strengthen my basics in Java.

This is just the beginning â€” I plan to expand this project and use it to learn more about Java and real-world software development.

Have any suggestions to improve the project? Feel free to share them!
